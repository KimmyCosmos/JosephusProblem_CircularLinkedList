# Josephus Problem - Circular Linked List (C++)

This project implements the Josephus problem using a circular linked list in C++. The Josephus problem is a theoretical puzzle where people are arranged in a circle, and every nth person is eliminated until only one remains. The program builds a circular linked list, iterates through it, and removes nodes according to the specified elimination pattern.

This project was completed as part of a data structures and algorithms course.
